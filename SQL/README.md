## SQL Data Analysis

This section outlines the approach and key insights derived from analyzing the e-commerce dataset using SQL. The SQL queries executed in this project leverage advanced SQL concepts such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, inner joins, CASE statements, row numbering, and GROUP BY clauses to extract and transform data into valuable insights.

### Analysis Goals

1. **Credit Limit Analysis**:
   - Identify customers along with their credit limits to monitor financial exposure and risk.

2. **Late Shipping Analysis**:
   - Detect customers affected by late shipping to improve delivery processes and customer satisfaction.

3. **Over Credit Limit Analysis**:
   - List customers who have exceeded their credit limit to manage credit risk and ensure timely payments.

4. **Office Sales by Customer Country**:
   - Analyze sales data categorized by customer country to understand regional performance and strategize market expansion.

5. **Products Purchased Together**:
   - Identify products frequently purchased together to optimize cross-selling strategies and inventory management.

6. **Sales and Country Overview**:
   - Provide an overview of sales performance by country to identify high-performing regions and allocate resources effectively.

7. **Sales Value Change from Previous Order**:
   - Calculate the change in sales value from the previous order to track sales trends and identify growth opportunities.

## Advanced SQL Queries

### 1. Top Products by Sales & Profit
This query finds the top 5 products based on total sales and profit.

### 2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
This query analyzes the most valuable customers based on total orders, revenue, and profit.



### SQL Concepts Used

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
  - Simplify complex queries by breaking them down into more manageable parts.
  
- **Subqueries**:
  - Extract data needed for further analysis within the main query.
  
- **Inner Joins**:
  - Combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns.
  
- **CASE Statements**:
  - Implement conditional logic within queries to categorize and compute values.
  
- **Row Number**:
  - Assign unique row numbers to result set rows, useful for ranking and limiting results.
  
- **GROUP BY Clauses**:
  - Aggregate data to produce summary statistics such as totals and averages.

### Key Insights

- **Financial Exposure**: The analysis of customer credit limits reveals the overall financial exposure and helps in managing credit risk.
- **Delivery Performance**: Late shipping analysis highlights areas for improvement in the delivery process, aiming to enhance customer satisfaction.
- **Credit Risk Management**: Identifying customers who exceed their credit limit assists in mitigating credit risks and ensuring timely payments.
- **Regional Sales Performance**: Analyzing office sales by customer country provides insights into regional performance, aiding in strategic decision-making.
- **Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Identifying products frequently purchased together helps in optimizing cross-selling strategies and improving inventory management.
- **Sales Trends**: An overview of sales by country and changes in sales value from previous orders helps track trends and identify growth opportunities.

### Conclusion

The SQL analysis performed in this project transforms raw e-commerce data into actionable insights. By leveraging advanced SQL concepts and focusing on key areas such as credit limits, late shipping, regional sales performance, and product bundling, this analysis supports data-driven decision-making and strategic planning. These insights help improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall business performance.
